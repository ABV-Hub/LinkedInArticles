def adaptive_choice_P(sigma, eps=1e-7):
    """
    Adaptive choice of the value of the number of periods in the frequency
    domain used to compute the Fourier transform of a Morlet wavelet.

    This function considers a Morlet wavelet defined as the sum
    of
    * a Gabor term hat psi(omega) = hat g_{sigma}(omega - xi)
    where 0 < xi < 1 is some frequency and g_{sigma} is
    the Gaussian window defined in Fourier by
    hat g_{sigma}(omega) = e^{-omega^2/(2 sigma^2)}
    * a low pass term \\hat \\phi which is proportional to \\hat g_{\\sigma}.

    If \\sigma is too large, then these formula will lead to discontinuities
    in the frequency interval [0, 1] (which is the interval used by numpy.fft).
    We therefore choose a larger integer P >= 1 such that at the boundaries
    of the Fourier transform of both filters on the interval [1-P, P], the
    magnitude of the entries is below the required machine precision.
    Mathematically, this means we would need P to satisfy the relations:

    |\\hat \\psi(P)| <= eps and |\\hat \\phi(1-P)| <= eps

    Since 0 <= xi <= 1, the latter implies the former. Hence the formula which
    is easily derived using the explicit formula for g_{\\sigma} in Fourier.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sigma: float
        Positive number controlling the bandwidth of the filters
    eps : float, optional
        Positive number containing required precision. Defaults to 1e-7

    Returns
    -------
    P : int
        integer controlling the number of periods used to ensure the
        periodicity of the final Morlet filter in the frequency interval
        [0, 1[. The value of P will lead to the use of the frequency
        interval [1-P, P[, so that there are 2*P - 1 periods.

    Computes the Fourier transform of a Morlet filter.

    A Morlet filter is the sum of a Gabor filter and a low-pass filter

    the cancelling parameter.
